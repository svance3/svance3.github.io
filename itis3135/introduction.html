                <li><span class="b">Personal Background:</span> Hey everyone! I am originally from southern Florida. I moved to North Carolina in 1999, and have lived in and around the Charlotte area ever since. I love nature, photography, and programming. 

                <li><span class="b">Professional Background:</span> I have been working professionally in technology for about 12 years now. I have experience in technician work, software development, small business technology solutions, process automation, management, web development, and networking. I currently work in education at a local private school as an IT administrator and middle and high school computer teacher. I teach classes on programming, web design, graphic design, and general computer.</li>

                <li><span class="b">Academic Background:</span>  As a non-traditional student, my technology skills are predominantly self-taught. My grandfather was a senior security engineer at NASA which prompted my early interest in technology, security, and development. I hope to complete my B.S. in computer science with a concentration in cyber security by the end of this calendar year.</li>

                <li><span class="b">Background in this Subject:</span>  I built my first webpage in 2002 using a book I rented from the Matthews library to learn HTML, and started my first website in 2004. I have a great deal of personal and professional experience with software development, but have always preferred web development over all else. Most of my professional experience in this area has been in backend development, specializing in object oriented PHP applications used as database transactional middle-services. I have built more web apps &amp; websites than I can count, and currently teach the subject at the high-school level.  I am currently in the process of remaking my personal website.</li>

                <li><span class="b">Primary Computer Platform:</span>  I use OpenSUSE Tumbleweed for all of my personal computers, and a mixture of OpenSUSE Leap, Ubuntu, and Slackware for my various servers.

                    </ul>
                <li><span class="b">Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</span> I love British cars! The photo above was taken on a mountain adventure I went on in the Appalachian Mountains shortly after purchasing one of my childhood dream cars: an early-model Land Rover Discovery II.</li>
                <li><span class="b">I'd also like to Share:</span>  I never get tired of web development! I'm looking forward to the class!</li>
